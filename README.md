This is a weather forecast app. It shows weather information for the location that the user selects. Users have the flexibility to select a city and country name for which they want the weather forecast. The user can switch between hourly, daily, and weekly forecasts. The app shows daily maximum, minimum, and current temperatures. It displays an icon to depict current weather with a small description like cloudy, sunny, etc. The same functionality is also available for hourly forecasts. 

This dynamic web-app is developed using ReactJS. Used the weather API provided by Open Weather Map. Material-ui library was used for pre-built react components. Used the node package manager for managing dependencies. Verified the data returned from APIs using Postman.

*** Assignment Question ***
Build a weather forecasting application using REACT
Display a 5-day weather forecast, where each day shows the high and low temperatures and an image for sunny/rainy/cloudy/snowy. Use fake, hard-coded data until you’ve got everything rendering correctly.
Add the ability to click on a day and see its hourly forecast. You can just maintain the current view in the top-level App state.
Add React Router to the project (npm install react-router) and add routes, such that / shows the 5-day forecast, and /[name-of-day] shows the hourly forecast for a particular day.
Sign up for a free API key from https://openweathermap.org/ (Links to an external site.)
Fetch a real 5-day forecast, and feed that data into your app.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
